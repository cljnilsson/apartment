# Quiz Battle - Typescript Fullstack Project

# Description
The basis of the project is simple, pick a pre-made quiz, answer the questions present in the form of multiple choice answers.  
I intend to put a slight creative spin on it. Optionally you play a quiz in PvP mode with a friend, your quiz will be timed.
There are a lot of possibilities such as sabotaging the other's question(s) by adding extra options, removing characters from the question etc.  

# Purpose
Learning.  
Previously I have used class components exclusively in React. I also used Redux.
In this project I will exclusively use functional components and context as a substitute to Redux.  
I am also adding other convenience requirements such as react-query and type-orm.  

# Features
(Some of the features listed might not be implemented yet, it is meant to show my vision for the end product)
* CRUD quiz creation with GUI
* Graph Highscore Ladder
* PvP mode
* Single and select all that apply answer
* Automatically generated quiz
* Responsive through React and caching
